I am a proactive and innovative Full Stack Software Engineer with experience of Javascript (Web Components, React, Angular, Node) and C# (.Net) as well as a range of other technologies and frameworks. Throughout my time as a Software Engineer I have combined creativity, a high level of technical knowledge and enthusiasm for learning and developing. I am passionate about writing lightweight, maintainable code that is clean, tested, reusable and delivers the right outcome for customers.

## Key Technical Skills

JavaScript, nodeJS, Web components, React, HTML 5, AWS, Docker, Microservices, MongoDB, Git, Github, C#, .NET 5.0, .NET Core 3.1, .NET Framework 4.8, Test Driven Development, Behaviour Driven Development, Agile Development.

## Skills

### Excellent communicator
I regularly contribute to a company wide showcase, and have run a range of sessions for colleagues to share technical knowledge, good practice or to find a consensus on our approach to specific technical challenges. I contribute effectively in ceremonies helping to shape work and ways of working, pair effectively on technical tasks and as a former teacher I have a great deal of experience in this area which means colleagues regularly seek my advice or feedback.

### Fast learner
From re-training through to my current position, I have shown that I am able to assimilate new knowledge and skills quickly. This allows me to move smoothly between tasks and projects, work with a range of technical and non-technical stakeholders and develop any additional required abilities so that I can contribute effectively regardless of the challenge.

### Analytical thinker
I am a firm believer in the maxim "Solve the problem, then write the code". When developing solutions I focus on the need to develop simple, lighweight solutions that can easily be maintained and which are based on solid foundations of correct data structures and clean code. I also apply a similar approach to developing effective ways of working, carefully considering the balance between weight of process, quality and velocity.

### Effective Leader
A constant from every role I have ever undertaken is that I always take responsibility and ownership for challenges, while bringing people with me. The combination of technical and interpersonal skills highlighted above, allied to my leadership experience allows me to work in a way that both contributes most effectively to a team and gets the best out of my colleagues. I am reflective and constantly look for a better balance of process and solution focus, I am flexible enough to change approach based upon circumstances and as an effective communicator I am effective in developing a shared vision among any team.
